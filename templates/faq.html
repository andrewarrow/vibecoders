    <h2 class="faq-question">What is vibecoding and who coined the term?</h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">

    <a class="link" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">tweet</a> on Feb 2, 2025. The text was the following: There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

    <h2 class="faq-question">Is vibecoding replacing traditional coding?</h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">Vibecoding isn't replacing traditional coding but evolving it. Understanding programming fundamentals, algorithms, and system design remains essential. The difference is that vibecoders can accomplish more in less time by delegating implementation details to AI tools while focusing on higher-level architecture and business problems.</p>

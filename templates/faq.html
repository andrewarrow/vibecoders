    <h2 class="faq-question">What is vibecoding and who coined the term?</h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">
    <a class="link" href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy</a> sent this
    <a class="link" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">x/tweet</a> on Feb 2, 2025. The text was the following: There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

    <h2 class="faq-question">look, i'm as big an andrej fan as the next guy but this has gotten entirely out of hand. he's not actually recommending this as a best practice or certainly not a differentiator to hire people on. </h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">
      I agree this is for weekend projects or side projects where this type of code is not a problem.
      But soon it will be what you do at your real job!
      The point is it's going to get better and better very quickly and all coders should learn
      this skill or be left behind. Because in a few years this will be all "coders" do anymore.

    <h2 class="faq-question">Anyone actually interested in growing as a developer should run screaming from anyone who promises that you can level up by substituting actual expertise for a model that will gladly give you bug-riddled code you don't understand and can't fix on your own.</h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">
      I never said this. I said we developers who already know how to code, should also learn
      how to vibe code. Because lots of non-coders are going to try and learn vibe coding without
      all the knowledge we have. We are the ones who should be vibing!

    <h2 class="faq-question">at least there is now a new word for "script kiddy".</h2>
    <p class="faq-answer">I'm sure lots of people with very little knowledge of coding
    will try this and make really bad stuff. That doesn't mean someone with lots
    of coding knowledge can't use it to build amazing thing.</p>

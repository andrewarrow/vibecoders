              <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy</a> sent this
              <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">x/tweet</a> on Feb 2, 2025. The text was the following: There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

              I agree this is for weekend projects or side projects where this type of code is not a problem.
              But soon it will be what you do at your real job!
              The point is it's going to get better and better very quickly and all coders should learn
              this skill or be left behind. Because in a few years this will be all "coders" do anymore.

            <div class="text-gray-300">
              I never said this. I said we developers who already know how to code, should also learn
              how to vibe code. Because lots of non-coders are going to try and learn vibe coding without
              all the knowledge we have. We are the ones who should be vibing!

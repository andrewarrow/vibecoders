        VibeCoders was founded with a simple mission: to connect organizations with software engineers who excel at leveraging AI tools for development. We believe that the future of coding lies in the synergy between human creativity and machine intelligence.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As AI coding assistants become more sophisticated, we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how software is built. Vibecoders are at the forefront of this revolution, focusing on system design and architecture while delegating implementation details to AI partners.

    <div class="t-card-content space-y-6">
      <p>
        VibeCoders began in early 2024 when a group of developers noticed how dramatically their productivity increased when working with AI coding tools. Instead of spending hours on boilerplate code and debugging, they could focus on the creative aspects of software development.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What started as a small community of like-minded engineers has grown into a platform connecting companies with developers who have mastered the art of vibecoding. Today, we're helping organizations build better software faster by matching them with engineers who embody this new approach to development.
